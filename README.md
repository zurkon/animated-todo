A smoothly animated ToDo build with [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/), [`Framer Motion`](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and [`TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/).

</div>

## Description

This project was inspired by project [`animated-todo`](https://github.com/craftzdog/react-native-animated-todo) made by [`craftzdog`](https://github.com/craftzdog) using React Native.

But, instead of building with React Native and Reanimated, my challenge was build using [`Framer motion`](https://www.framer.com/motion/), for animation, and [`TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/), for styling and Dark Mode.

## Libraries

This project was made using:

- [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/) - Library for building user interfaces.
- [`Framer Motion`](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - A JavaScript 3D Library.
- [`TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A lightweight 3D physics engine written in JavaScript.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
